## My process

### Built with

- React class based components
- Redux
- Sass (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Modules
- React Transition Group
- React Testing Lirary and Jest



### What I learned

In this project I focused more on using class based components since until now i created mostly react projects with functional based components.
I also embedded Redux and for the first time I used Redux with class based components.
I also started learning Jest and React Testing Library (on a very basic level).
I evolved a lot on how to make images more responsive.
